Dark Pattern Alert
==================

This is a proof-of-concept for a [Dark Pattern](http://darkpatterns.org) Alert Chrome extension. It alerts the user if a website practices deceptive user interfaces. URL are matched against dark patterns locally to preserve the user's privacy.

TODO
----
* Disable dark pattern alert for a website (at least temporarily) if the user closed the alert
* Load dark patterns from an URL with auto-update (currently embedded in extension)
* Allow user to report websites (currently unimplemented)
* Allow user to disable certain types of alerts
